\paragraph{Context and motivation}

Online chess has become increasingly popular, with website Chess.com hosting an average of x [Lila find and cite] games every day. Users may play with friends or strangers, and a wide variety of chess variants and time-controls are available to play with. It's rise in popularity follows the increase in free time during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, popularity of Netflix's show 'The Queen's Gambit', and world-ranking players streaming the game on Twitch \cite{The2020ChessBoom} With a sudden increase in online players comes an increase in publicly available game data. This provides opportunity for investigation into player's strengths, measured by ELO (a number corresponding to skill level).

[Lila where? to put this bit:]

This report studies a dataset of 60,000 games, analysing the impact a difference in ELO (score related to playing ability in chess) makes on the outcome of a game. We also consider whether ELO may be predicted from a player's response to an 'en passant' move.

\paragraph{Previous work}

Brief description of any previous work in this area (e.g., in the
media, or scientific literature or blogs).

An article in the literature found [Lila put what it found] about the ELO \cite{HowMuchDoesEloMatter}.
There is no literature directly studying the relationship between a player's response to 'en passant' moves and their ELO.
\paragraph{Objectives}

% What questions are you setting out to answer?
Commonly, chess tactics are a way to gain an inherent advantage in the game state. Thus, a highly ranked chess player could plan ahead several moves just to obtain this state. Common tactics are ones that most players that are somewhat into chess will recognise as an advantageous move, but being able to consistently plan to apply the knowledge is what separates a good chess player from a great one. However, one exception to this is the move \textit{en-passant}. This is a far more situational tactic, and heavily relies on your opponent to move a certain way for a player to be able to utilise it. More importantly, often it does not leave the board in an advantageous state for the moving player. Due to this, compared to most other chess tactics, generally using en-passant will not be the optimal move. Therefore, if you are highly ranked and playing to win, chances are that you would not take it given the chance. However, in the chess scene, and especially in online chess which is where this dataset is sourced from, the move has gained a cult-like following. Since most people that are active in the online chess scene will be lower elo, we can use this fact to try and predict the elo of an individual player based on the chance they will take an en-passant, since we can assume that the higher the elo you are, the less likely to take it

\section{Data}
% Suggested 300 words

% Who created the dataset(s)?  How you have
% obtained it (e.g., file or web scraping), and do the T\&Cs allow you
% to use obtain the data for the project?

\paragraph{Data provenance}
We obtained our data from Kaggle.com \cite{Kaggle}, where they provided a dataset of over 60,000 games of chess taken from Chess.com. The terms and conditions on Chess.com state that you are not allowed to datamine, but in this case the dataset was extracted using the Chess.com API so it complies with their regulations.

% Description of the data, e.g. variables
% in each table, number of records.
\paragraph{Data description}
The dataset records 66879 games of chess that took place on Chess.com with varying game modes, time classes, and levels of players. The data is all in one database but the columns are effectively split up into two sections. The first are the main columns, while the final column is the PGN. The main columns include basic data i.e. the usernames and links of players, the ELO ratings of each player, the result of both players, the time control and time class, the rules the game was played on, and the final board state. On the other hand, the PGN (Portable Game Notation) is a column in a standard format to be easily read by other chess analyzers. Thus it has a lot of the same information the previous fields do, but it also includes important information like the opening moves, and especially the last field which is a list of all the moves that took place during that game. Using the PGN we can simulate and replay exactly how the game was played, and analyse using that.

% How you have processed the dataset, e.g.,
% cleaning, removing missing values, joining tables.
\paragraph{Data processing}
The data was well set out, so it did not need much cleaning in terms of removing invalid entries or N/A values. However, since the dataset includes lots of different modes of games, some which are not standard chess, we removed them since they wouldn't be an accurate representation of an average chess game. One example of a chess variation is Chess960, where the positions of the

A data science analysis of the paper, including: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualisations (for example
  Figure~\ref{fds-project-template:fig:log_regression}) and tables (for
  example Table~\ref{tab:log_regression}). Please make sure that all figures
  and tables are referred to in the text, as demonstrated in this
  bullet point.
\item Interpretation of the results 
\item Description of how you have applied one ore more of the
  statistical and ML methods learned in the FDS to the data
\item Interpretation of the findings 
\end{itemize}

You can use equations like this:
\begin{equation}
  \label{fds-project-template:eq:1}
  \overline{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
\end{equation}
or maths inline: $E=mc^2$. However, you do not need to reexplain techniques that you have learned in the course -- assume the reader understands linear regression, logistic regression K-nearest neighbours etc.  Remember to explain any symbols use, e.g.~``$n$ is the number of data points and $x_i$ is the value of the $i$th data point.''.

\paragraph{Comparison with any other related work}
E.g. ``Anscombe has also demonstrated that many patterns of data can
have the same correlation coefficient'' \cite{anscombe1973graphs}.

Wikipedia can also be cited but it is better if you find the original
reference it for a particular claim in the list of references on the
Wikipedia page, read it, and cite it.

The golden rule is always to cite information that has come from other
sources, to avoid plagiarism \cite{wiki:plagarism}. \cite{HowMuchDoesEloMatter}
